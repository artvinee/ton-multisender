# TON Multisender

Distributes specified amount of TON from one wallet to other wallets from wallets.txt

Uses free TonCenter API (with or without key). I recommend getting a free key from @tonapibot

We put addresses in wallets.txt, tonsender.py has settings.
Only v4r2 wallet is used as parent wallet.
